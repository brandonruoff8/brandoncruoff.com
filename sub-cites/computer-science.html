	<h3> <a href="computer-science/hello_world_runnable.jar" download class="gray-button"> Hello world! </a> </h3>
	<p class="center-whole"> 
		Simply said, this download will make a window pop up that says "Hello!" It was my test to see if 
		I could post executable code on my website for other people to try.
	<h3> <a href="" class="gray-button"> Pok&eacute;mon Battle </a> </h3>

		The game is still incomplete.

	<p class="center-whole">
		I know a lot about Pokemon, so I am attempting to build a simple battle simulator. It includes a variety of Pokemon to
		choose from to create a full party of 6 Pokemon. The player faces off against an AI that represents me. Currently only
		damage is implemented--status moves, special effects of moves, and abilities will come later.

	<h3> <a href="computer-science/mini_calculator.jar" download class="gray-button"> Mini Calculator </a> </h3>
	<p class="center-whole">
		I built a simple Calculator program build from JFrame for one of my classes. It can take two numbers as input at a time in the following
		format: 
		</br></br>
		[integer1][function][integer2]
		</br>
		(for example: 22+8)
		</br></br>
		It cannot use decimals as an input, but the division function will in fact supply a decimal answer.
